                        Jackson on Tuesday said "I've talked with a couple coaches so far and they
                        all been treating me well, but the three realistic places that I could play 
                        next year are in New Orleans, for the Jets or if Brady leaves I'll bring the

                        Super Bowl champion Buccaneers in Tampa Bay. “I’m going to say it, but there is a

                         “Let’s Go!” with Jim Gray, and was asked if he has a timetable as to when he
                         will decide whether he will retire or return for a 24th NFL season. 
                         “Jim, if I knew what I was going to f***ing do, I’d have already f***ing done it,”
                          Brady, once again an NFL free agent, said. “I’m taking it a day at a time.”
                         Gray pleaded that it was the question that everyone wanted to hear. Brady was undeterred.
                         “You’re scratching. I appreciate your asking. Thank you,” he said.</td>

                    <td>SEAN PAYTON (HEAD COACH SAINTS): The hottest commodity in the coaching market is undoubtedly retired Super-Bowl-winning
                         head coach Sean Payton, and following Harbaugh’s decision to pull himself out of the 
                         running, the demand for Payton is sure to escalate. Payton, who retired while still under 
                        contract with the Saints following the 2021 season, is expected to soon be back on the NFL 
                        sidelines.The Texans announced they had interviewed the 59-year-old last Tuesday (AEDT), while
                         Payton also interviewed for the Broncos head coaching vacancy this week and is scheduled to meet
                          the Panthers early this week. However, in order for a team to sign the veteran coach 
                        they must first negotiate a trade with New Orleans, due to him being still under contract with 
                        the Saints when he retired, and according to Payton – the price could be a high one.
                        “I think each team would be a little different. Mickey Loomis (Saints GM) and I have talked 
                        already about it. I think ultimately the compensation for the Saints would be a mid or later 
                        first round pick,” Payton said during a recent appearance on ‘The Herd with Colin Cowherd’.
                        “Now we can arrive at that in a lot of different ways. I think Denver has a (first round) pick 
                        that they acquired back when they traded (Bradley Chubb), it’s the 49ers pick, but each team has
                         got different ammo or different pick selections and it could be a future one maybe where you have
                          to throw in something. “I say this because I know Mickey well … he’s got a job to
                         do as a general manager with the Saints and he’ll get the right compensation and I’m sure the team, 
                         if it gets that far, will arrive it (fair compensation). “Probably this year it would be a 
                        mid to late first round pick I would say. Now it changes if nothing happens this year and we go 
                        (through this process) next year, then that (the compensation) changes considerably.”</td>

                    <td>BRIAN DABOLL (HEAD COACH GIANTS): Brian Daboll came over to the Giants after serving as the Buffalo Bills’ offensive co-ordinator, 
                        and he lured Mike Kafka away from the Kansas City Chiefs to be his offensive co-ordinator. Kafka
                         called plays throughout the pre-season, and Daboll was impressed enough that he handed over play-calling 
                         to him for the regular season.Kafka is only in his first season as an offensive co-ordinator. 
                         The 35-year-old was previously on the Kansas City Chiefs’ staff from 2017-21, serving in various roles
                        over that span. However, teams interested in hiring Kafka to be their head coach have had to be patient after 
                        New York head coach Brian Daboll shared last Tuesday (AEDT) that Kafka wouldn’t be interviewing ahead of the 
                        Giants’ divisional-round game against the Philadelphia Eagles.
